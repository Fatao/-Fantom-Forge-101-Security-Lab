# Fantom-Forge-101 Security Lab

**A small, isolated VirtualBox home lab for learning offensive & defensive security.**

---

## Mission
Build a repeatable, offline environment to practice pentesting and defensive skills using VirtualBox, Kali Linux, Metasploit, and a Windows Server target. All work is done in an isolated network for safety and learning.

---

## Disclaimer
This lab is for **educational purposes only**. Do not scan, attack, or exploit systems you do not own or do not have explicit written permission to test. Always follow the law and professional ethics.

---

## Quick Setup 
1. Install **VirtualBox** on your host machine.  
2. Download and verify **Kali Linux** ISO (attacker VM).  
3. Download a **Windows Server** evaluation ISO (target VM).  
4. Create an isolated Host-Only network (e.g., `ff101_internal`) and attach both VMs to it.  
5. Install VMs, take a snapshot after each clean install, and keep the network isolated from your home LAN/Internet unless intentionally required.
